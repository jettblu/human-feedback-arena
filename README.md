# Learning With Human Feedback

This project offers a full stack solution for training machine learning models with online human feedback. While our initial work only includes reinforcement approaches, we would like to expand coverage to include non RL methods.

A lot of the backend code is pulled from this [implementation](https://github.com/nottombrown/rl-teacher). We hope we have reduced the complexity of the original implementation to its most essential components, while providing a production ready demo for researchers to experiment with.
